# Virtual Whiteboard - Java GUI Application

## Overview

It's a Java Swing-based desktop application called **Virtual Whiteboard** that allows users to draw, write, interact on a virtual whiteboard. It has freehand drawing tools, shapes, text input, and eraser, as well as customizable options such as brush color, stroke width, and the preservation of the whiteboard as an image. Before being directed to the whiteboard, the users come across a humble login page for the application.
